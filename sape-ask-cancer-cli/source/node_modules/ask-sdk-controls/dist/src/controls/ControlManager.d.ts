/**
 * Defines the high-level functionality for a skill built with Controls.
 *
 * Each skill that uses controls should define a concrete sub-class that
 * implements `createControlTree` and optionally overrides other methods.
 *
 * Summary:
 *  * createControlTree() creates a hierarchy of controls that cooperatively
 *    manage the skill behavior.
 *   * The methods on the root control will be called to process the user's
 *     input and to generate system initiative.
 *
 *  * render() is the entry-point for the render-phase.
 *   * High-level overrides and multi-act rendering should be performed by
 *     `controlManager.render()`. The default is to render each act one-by-one
 *     by calling `control.renderAct(act)`.  This builds up a result by
 *     concatenation of response fragments which is sufficient in many cases.
 *
 *  * The `ControlResult` contains a list of SystemActs that describe *what*
 *    should be communicated to the user but generally should not describe *how*
 *    to present it.
 *
 *  * `handleInternalError` provides an entry-point for custom handling of
 *    internal errors.
 *
 *  * `buildInteractionModel` provides an entry-point for building the
 *    Control-specific aspects of skill's Interaction Model.
 *
 * Internationalization and Localization
 *  * Controls themselves are location-agnostic.  They consume abstract inputs
 *    (Intents, etc) and produce abstract outputs (SystemActs)
 *
 *  * Mapping localized input to abstract inputs is the role of NLU and the
 *    necessary information is stored in the Interaction Model.
 *   * The ControlManager props includes a bag of localization data that is used
 *     during interaction-model building for a given locale.
 *   * The framework ships with a default set of interaction model data for
 *     en-US.
 *
 *  * Mapping abstract output to physical output (prompts, APL strings) etc is
 *    the role of the rendering phase.  This information is part of the skill
 *    definition but can be located in various places: either in a monolithic
 *    render() function, or scattered around the various Controls and Acts.

     * Transforms the information in ControlResult into user-facing content
     * (prompts and APL).
     *
     * Default: The default rendering strategy renders each `SystemAct` in turn
     *          by calling `act.control.render(act)`. This strategy leads to
     *          prompts that are a concatenation of the prompt-fragment for each
     *          `SystemAct`.
     *
     * Usage:
     *  * In many situations rendering the acts one-by-one is sufficient as the
     *    concatenation of prompt fragments leads to usable prompts.  For
     *    example
     *
     * ```js
     *    [ValueSetAct(ageCtrl, 5), RequestValueAct(nameCtrl)]
     * ```
     *    may be rendered sequentially to produce:
     *
     * ```js
     *    -> 'OK, 5. What is your name?"
     * ```
     *
     *    * For more complex situations, override this method and implement a
     *      custom rendering strategy.  Often the solution will be to implement
     *      some special cases and otherwise fallback to the default by calling
     *      super.render() or by directly calling
     *      `ControlManager.renderActsOneByOne()`.
